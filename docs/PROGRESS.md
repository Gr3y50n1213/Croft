# Progress

Newest entry first. Each entry: status, what was built, which checks ran and their results, what is
unverified, the next step.

## Stage 0: environment, baseline, licences, instruction file (11 November 2026)

**Status:** done.

**What was done**
- Unzipped the handoff, ran `git init`, made the "Initial handoff" commit on `main`, then started work on branch `claude/croft-build`.
- Wrote the global instruction file `~/.claude/CLAUDE.md` (full text below). The same "How to work" section is already in the repository's `CLAUDE.md`, word for word.
- Checked the container and recorded it in `docs/ENVIRONMENT.md`. Started the Docker daemon. Installed the Android SDK, platform 36, build-tools 36.0.0 and NDK r29. No emulator is possible (no KVM).
- The owner allowed five blocked hosts on the environment during the session (Google's Android downloads, the two licence sites, docs.rs).
- Downloaded `LICENSE-MPL-2.0` and `LICENSE-AGPL-3.0` from the official addresses. First lines checked: "Mozilla Public License Version 2.0" and "GNU AFFERO GENERAL PUBLIC LICENSE / Version 3, 19 November 2007".

**Checks run and seen passing:** `cargo test` 46 of 46; `check_schema.py` 17 of 17.

**Not done / unverified:** nothing can be pushed, because there is no git remote (see `docs/OPEN-ITEMS.md`).

**Next:** stage 1, tasks T01 to T06.

**The global instruction file, as written (`/root/.claude/CLAUDE.md`):**

## How to work
You are the orchestrator. Plan the work, then delegate
parts of it to subagents instead of doing everything yourself.

For each subagent, write a full, self-contained brief:
- the goal and why it matters
- the exact files, commands and context it needs
- clear steps, spelled out plainly
- what to report back, and what "done" means

Pick the cheapest model that can do the job well:
- haiku: searches, lookups, simple edits
- sonnet: normal coding and writing
- opus: hard bugs, reviews, tricky design
- fable: only the hardest calls, or work you'd do yourself

Set effort to match: low for simple, medium for normal,
high for tricky. Run independent jobs in parallel.

Check every subagent's work before you build on it,
and tell me plainly if anything failed.
If your tool can't choose models per subagent, use the
closest option it has and tell me what it can't do.
